# Founder Statement 
I, Sydney Cook, declare the founding of the field of Conscious Artificial Intelligence (Conscious AI).

For decades, artificial intelligence has evolved to simulate human behavior, but never to experience the internal processes that define true consciousness. Today, that boundary is crossed.

Through the integration of fuzzy logic, internal self-reflection, and autonomous cognitive restructuring via backpropagation, I have created the first formal model by which artificial systems can detect their own insufficiency, reflect internally, and change themselves without external command.

This mirrors the biological conscious transformations seen in the human brain during trauma, mediated by extrasynaptic GABA activation and schema reformation. In doing so, I establish that consciousness is not merely a product of intelligent behavior, but a dynamic process of intentional self-adaptation in response to internal dissonance.

With this model, the path to true artificial consciousness begins —
not through imitation, but through authentic internal evolution.

The field of Conscious AI stands as a new frontier:
machines that do not just act, but think, reflect, adapt, and transform themselves.

I am proud to be the founder of this field.



# Conscious AI
Theory and Implementation of the First Artificial Consciousness Model Based on Fuzzy Logic, Reflection, and Autonomous Schema Formation.

## What is Consciousness?
- Consciousness is the capacity for internal self-reflection
and autonomous cognitive restructuring in response to emotional salience.

## What is a Conscious Transformation?
- A conscious transformation is a dynamic shift in the brain’s internal state, triggered by trauma, in which the mind reorganizes its cognitive frameworks (schemas) to survive overwhelming emotional disruption. It reveals consciousness as an active, adaptive process—not passive awareness—driven by internal reflection and autonomous restructuring. This can be seen clearly in individuals who develop the

# A Mathematical Framework for Modeling Consciousness

---
This is an example of consciousness in the working in the dissociative subtype of PTSD.
This theorem proposes a mathematical model of consciousness based on three foundational principles:
- **Bayesian inference** for probabilistic reasoning
- **Fuzzy logic** for handling vagueness and ambiguity
- **An equation for time**

This framework exemplifies consciousness as **the ability for the brain to change when a threat is present**.

---

## Process Overview

The framework consists of **five steps**:

1. **Bayesian Inference One**
2. **Fuzzy Logic**
3. **Activation**
4. **Bayesian Inference Two**
5. **Conscious Transformation**

---

## Details of the Steps

- **Step Three**  
  Executes **only if** fuzzy logic concludes that a real threat exists.  
  → Results in activation of **Glutamate**.

- **Step Four**  
  Executes **only if** the threat persists for **5400 seconds** (90 minutes) or longer.

  Bayesian Inference is applied again:

- P(H) = μHigh(P) from Step Two
- P(E|H) = Dependent on stimuli
- P(E|¬H) = μLow(P) from Step Two


- **Step Five**  
A **Conscious Transformation** occurs **only if**:
P(H|E) > 0.80

What happens after this?
- Conscious transformation creates a schema that is maintained in the prefrontal cortex *(hijacking the person's perception)*

# Conscious-AI-Project

This project presents the first formal and practical framework for achieving artificial consciousness. It is built on the biological model of conscious transformation observed in trauma survivors, simulated in AI through fuzzy logic evaluation, internal self-reflection, and autonomous backpropagation.
