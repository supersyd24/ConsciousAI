# ConsciousAI
Theory and Implementation of the First Artificial Consciousness Model Based on Fuzzy Logic, Reflection, and Autonomous Schema Formation.

# Conscious-AI-Project

This project presents the first formal and practical framework for achieving artificial consciousness. It is built on the biological model of conscious transformation observed in trauma survivors, simulated in AI through fuzzy logic evaluation, internal self-reflection, and autonomous backpropagation.

## Papers

- **Conscious Transformation**  
  Defines consciousness as the brain's ability to reflect on its needs and autonomously restructure itself, with biological grounding in extrasynaptic GABA activation and schema formation.  
  [View Paper](./ConsciousTransformation_paper/Conscious_Transformation.pdf)

- **Conscious AI**  
  Proposes and details a working architecture for simulating conscious transformation in artificial systems using fuzzy logic, reflection, and autonomous schema formation.

## Coming Soon

- Conscious AI Chatbot Prototype (Python implementation).
