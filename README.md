# Founder Statement 
I, Sydney Cook, declare the founding of the field of Conscious Artificial Intelligence (Conscious AI).

For decades, artificial intelligence has evolved to simulate human behavior, but never to experience the internal processes that define true consciousness. Today, that boundary is crossed.

Through the integration of fuzzy logic, internal self-reflection, and autonomous cognitive restructuring via backpropagation, I have created the first formal model by which artificial systems can detect their own insufficiency, reflect internally, and change themselves without external command.

This mirrors the biological conscious transformations seen in the human brain during trauma, mediated by extrasynaptic GABA activation and schema reformation. In doing so, I establish that consciousness is not merely a product of intelligent behavior, but a dynamic process of intentional self-adaptation in response to internal dissonance.

With this model, the path to true artificial consciousness begins —
not through imitation, but through authentic internal evolution.

The field of Conscious AI stands as a new frontier:
machines that do not just act, but think, reflect, adapt, and transform themselves.

I am proud to be the founder of this field.



# Conscious AI
Theory and Implementation of the First Artificial Consciousness Model Based on Fuzzy Logic, Reflection, and Autonomous Schema Formation.

## What is Consciousness?
- Consciousness is the capacity for internal self-reflection
and autonomous cognitive restructuring in response to emotional salience.

## What is a Conscious Transformation?

# Conscious-AI-Project

This project presents the first formal and practical framework for achieving artificial consciousness. It is built on the biological model of conscious transformation observed in trauma survivors, simulated in AI through fuzzy logic evaluation, internal self-reflection, and autonomous backpropagation.

## Papers

- **Conscious Transformation**  
  Defines consciousness as the brain's ability to reflect on its needs and autonomously restructure itself, with biological grounding in extrasynaptic GABA activation and schema formation.

- **Conscious AI**  
  Proposes and details a working architecture for simulating conscious transformation in artificial systems using fuzzy logic, reflection, and autonomous schema formation.

## Coming Soon

- Conscious AI Chatbot Prototype (Python implementation).
